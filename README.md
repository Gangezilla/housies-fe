When my partner and I moved out of our share house into our new place, we had a conversation about wanting to pass on knowledge to the people who would start living in our old place. Knowledge like, what the land lord is like, or that if you open the master bedroom's windows at night you'll get flooded with cockroaches. Important stuff like that. 

Housies was born out of this idea of passing knowledge along to the next people who live in your old place. Originally I planned to try to make this into a real big app and market it properly to chase the #startup dream, but instead I just used it as a learning exercise, which is certainly an easier path. It's a bit inefficient at places, but it's okay. 

I'm working on building a new project every 4-6 months in 2018, and this is my December - January project. Stay tuned for what's next.

PS: Facebook login isn't working in Firefox for some reason (due to new privacy settings in Quantum, I think). So try this out in Chrome.
